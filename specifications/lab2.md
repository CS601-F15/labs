Lab 2 - YelpStore Read Methods
==========================

For this lab, you will complete the `YelpStore` data structure you implemented in Lab 1. This will provide you additional practice with Java data structures.

##Requirements##

For Lab 2, you are required to complete all methods in the class `cs601.yelpapp.data.YelpStore`. You must implement the methods `getBuinesses`, `getRating`, and `getUsers`. 

:warning: You may not make any modifications to the API or the test cases provided.

:warning: The only third-party library you may use for this project is [JSON Simple](https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/). The jar file required to use JSON Simple is already provided for you in the `lib` directory of the CS601Labs project on github. 

The Javadoc provided in the skeleton code provides specific descriptions of the expected behavior and output of each method.

##Hints##
1. Think carefully about **efficiency**. 
2. Make sure to follow good coding practices, including adhering to the suggested [style guidelines](https://github.com/CS601-F15/lectures/blob/master/Notes/style.md).
3. It is highly recommended that you design your own test cases; do not just rely on the test cases provided for you.


##Submission##
All tests in Lab2Test must pass before submission.

Follow these instructions *carefully* in order to submit your lab: [Lab Guidelines](https://github.com/CS601-F15/lectures/blob/master/Notes/labguidelines.md).
