Microcloud Node Assignments
===========================

Your Lab 5 solution must be running on the assigned microcloud server and port below in order to receive credit for the assignment. This server must be up and accepting HTTP requests when I sit down to grade your assignments! Please make sure your server is running *before* you create your Github release.

The micro cloud nodes are all on our private server subnet (10.0.1.0/24).  The gateway for this network is angry.cs.usfca.edu (10.0.1.1).  The actual nodes are 10.0.1.2 through 10.0.1.13 (DNS names mc01.cs.usfca.edu through mc12.cs.usfca.edu).

The machine specs are as follows:

From stargate or another lab machine (hrn235XX) ssh directly into mcXX.
